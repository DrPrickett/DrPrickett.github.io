      <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
      <p class="lead">Director and systems architect for instrument software. I’ve built and led multiple teams across the US and EU to deliver embedded and application-layer software for diagnostic platforms, partnering closely with R&amp;D, QA/RA, Operations, Finance, Yield Analysis, and Hardware teams to ensure releases land on time and audit-ready. My background spans 20+ years of software development and data science in regulated, safety-critical environments with hands-on work in instrument control, sensor I/O, calibration, and digital-thread/eDHR traceability. This experience translates directly to IVD-class instruments. I set the platform architecture runway, own portfolio roadmaps and release trains, and drive cross-site execution through clear governance (cadence, dependencies, risk/issue management) while developing senior talent and a healthy succession bench. Results include decision loops cut to &lt;2 minutes across global sites, queues reduced up to 25%, and $10M+ in supplier savings via contract renegotiations. I’m excited to bring this operating model to Abbott’s Infectious Diseases business and raise quality, speed, and confidence in every next-gen instrument we put in the field.</p>

      <h2>EXECUTIVE SNAPSHOT</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>$10M+ supplier wins:</strong> Introduced part-level scrap genealogy tied to supplier defects. The findings drove contract renegotiations and ongoing vendor quality enforcement.</li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio Shaping &amp; Demand Management:</strong> Operated a centralized intake across hundreds of global users from manufacturing, automation, quality and reliability, supply chain, and IT. Normalized and themed requests into a single prioritized portfolio, prioritized by ROI/effort, and converted them into a clear backlog of model/feature epics with quarterly OKRs and transparent commit/kill decisions. Through quarterly reviews with senior executives, produced recommendation lists for sequencing funding and delivery each quarter.</li>
        <li><strong>Program Leadership &amp; Strategy:</strong> Directed a $40M+ multi-site AI/ML portfolio spanning distributed systems, analytics, and automation. Drove GenAI-aligned roadmaps and cross-org execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Accounting integrity &amp; MES remediation:</strong> Discovered improper MES workflows causing a $500M+ loss accounting gap across newly implemented manufacturing technologies over two quarters. Instituted audits and spearheaded a cross-functional team (Automation, Finance, Yield, Quality/Reliability) to drive a remediation roadmap and quickly close gaps to prevent recurrence.</li>
        <li><strong>Global control &amp; telemetry:</strong> Cut global lot status lookups from 10–15 minutes/site to &lt;2 minutes. This enabled remote orchestration, audit-ready visibility, accelerated incident response, and compliance evidence gathering.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive stability &amp; early detection:</strong> Reduced cycle time variability by ~38% and prevented thousands of defective units annually via ML-assisted controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Functional Alignment:</strong> Partnered with software engineers, AI researchers, and product managers to synchronize technical capabilities with business objectives. Influenced enterprise re-architecture that avoided 5,000+ engineering hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Mentorship &amp; Talent Development:</strong> Managed managers and senior engineers while mentoring 50+ engineers across data, software, and DevOps into senior roles. Sustained 100% team retention through inclusive leadership practices.</li>

    <section class="section" id="achievements">
      <h2>SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supplier accountability &amp; margin protection:</strong> Turned vendor contractual performance specifications into enforceable contracts by tying part-level defects and uptime directly to vendor-quoted limits. Hard evidence powered $10M+ savings through contract renegotiations and monthly reviews that tracked root cause, owner, fix status, and effectiveness, shifting supplier management from reactive audits to continuous, data-driven accountability. For the MedTech field, this becomes real-time vendor scorecards (defect density by severity, time to fix SLAs, validated change control, SBOM/CVE hygiene) that make compliance a byproduct of doing the right thing.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Prioritization Framework (Agentic AI/ML Integration, first of its kind):</strong> Built the cross-site Product Prioritization Framework with a C# weighted model aggregator (Final Agent Publisher/Injector) that unified 50+ input models under governed limits. Four priority categories enabled nuanced but consistent scheduling; executives/managers could cap/disable models, rendering the previous linear model obsolete. Disparate model inputs ran in shadow-mode with full explainability before promotion. Result: queue times reduced up to 25%, utilization up ~15%, synchronized shipment for disaggregated product sets. A senior executive called it “the biggest transformation in prioritization logic in the last two decades.”</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive quality at scale for post-market surveillance:</strong> Operationalized 50+ ML systems with shadow mode staging, weekly threshold tuning, and audit-ready persistence of every decision/KPI. In fabs, this caught excursions early and reduced variability/scrap. In the MedTech field, the same pattern becomes constraint-aware post-market surveillance that surfaces safety-relevant anomalies first and shortens complaint classification cycles by 15–50%.</li>
        <li><strong>Global architecture &amp; hardware requirements:</strong> Led reference architectures and hardware requirement baselines across global sites (compute, storage, networking), grounded in capacity white paper research across industries. Drove design reviews and conformance gates so software, data pipelines, and instrument hardware shipped as one unified system across sites.</li>
        <li><strong>VF wide standards &amp; adoption:</strong> Drove Line Yield metrics, reusable analytics components, and up to ~500 wafer production starts improvements for constrained toolsets across operations. Enabled the upskilling of 200+ data analysts.</li>
      </ul>
